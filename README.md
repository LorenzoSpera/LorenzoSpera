## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am s Msc student in theoretical physics at the Univeristy of Perugia. I enjoy tackling complex problems presented by Nature and solving (almost never exactly) complicated equations. I also write code to translate theoretical concepts into more tangible results. I play the guitar and like sports.
In my repositories you will find some of the projetcs I have worlked on in the last few years, ranging from computational physics (monte carlo simulatiom, numerical techniques to compute integral and derivatives, Fourier analysis as well as solving ODE's and PDE's) to numerical/quantum simulation of physical theories.
