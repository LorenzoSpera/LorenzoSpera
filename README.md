## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am s Msc student in theoretical physics at the Univeristy of Perugia. I enjoy tackling complex problems presented by Nature and solving (almost never exactly) complicated equations. I also write code to translate theoretical concepts into more tangible results. I play the guitar and like sports.

In my repositories you will find some of the projetcs I have worked on in the last few years, ranging from computational physics (monte carlo simulatiom, numerical techniques to compute integrals and derivatives, implementing Fourier analysis as well as solving ODE's and PDE's) and numerical/quantum simulation of physical theories to software implementations of experimental physics techniques (i.e. high energy physics techniques) used in particle physics experiments.
